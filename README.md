Rubberduck is a COM Add-In for the VBA IDE that makes VBA development even more enjoyable, by extending the Visual Basic Editor (VBE) with menus, toolbars and toolwindows that enable things we didn't even think were possible when we first started this project.

If you're learning VBA, Rubberduck can help you avoid a few common beginner mistakes, and can probably show you a trick or two - even if you're only ever writing *macros*. If you're a more advanced programmer, you will appreciate the richness of [Rubberduck's feature set](https://github.com/retailcoder/Rubberduck/wiki/Features).

##Software & Libraries

###[ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/)

As of v1.2, Rubberduck is empowered by the awesomeness of ANTLR.

> **What is ANTLR?**

> *ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.*

We're not doing half of what we could be doing with this amazing tool. Try it, see for yourself!

###[LibGit2Sharp](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp)

**What is LibGit2Sharp?**

LibGit2Sharp is the library that has allowed us to integrate Git right into the VBA IDE (and as a nice bonus, expose a nice API that handles the nitty gritty of importing source files to and from the IDE to a repo for you).

> LibGit2Sharp brings all the might and speed of libgit2, a native Git implementation, to the managed world of .Net and Mono.

**Okay, so what is [libgit2](https://libgit2.github.com/)?**

> libgit2 is a portable, pure C implementation of the Git core methods provided as a re-entrant linkable library with a solid API, allowing you to write native speed custom Git applications in any language which supports C bindings.

Which basically means it's a reimplementation of Git in C. It also [happens to be the technology Microsoft uses for their own Git integration with Visual Studio](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/GitSupportForVisualStudioGitTFSAndVSPutIntoContext.aspx).

##Icons

We didn't come up with these icons ourselves! Here's who did what:

###[Fugue Icons](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/)

This beautiful suite of professional-grade icons packs over 3,570 icons (16x16). You name it, there's an icon for that.
